            Your privacy is important to us. It is Omnibug's policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we
            may collect from you across our website, <a href="https://omnibug.io/">https://omnibug.io/</a>, browser extension,
            and other sites we own and operate.
        </p>
        <h3 class="text-xl my-2 font-bold">1. Information we collect</h3>
        <h4 class="text-lg font-medium mb-2">Log data</h4>
        <p class="mb-4">
            When you visit our website, our servers may automatically log the standard data provided by your web browser.
            It may include your computer’s Internet Protocol (IP) address, your browser type and version, the pages you visit,
            the time and date of your visit, the time spent on each page, and other details.

        <p class="mb-4">
            <strong class="font-medium">Analytics in the Chromium-based Omnibug Extension</strong>: As of 2019-09-09, Google Analytics
            collects data in Chrome, Edge, Brave, Vivaldi, and any other browsers that use the Chrome Web Store as their extension marketplace,
            about how you interact with the extension, but <em>never</em> about the sites you're browsing or identifiable information about the
            providers you're using. We may collect data about what providers are enabled, how many requests are sent to each
            provider, etc., but never any information about what is sent to the provider. You may opt-out of this data collection
            in the extension settings "Send usage stats". We sincerely appreciate you leaving this checked as it helps us
            make better decisions about Omnibug.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-6">
            <strong class="font-medium">Analytics in the Firefox Omnibug Extension</strong>: As of 2019-09-09, no data is collected from Firefox
            users. This will likely change in the future and will be opt-in, as required with Mozilla's extension policies. When this happens,
            we'll update this privacy policy with the date this took place as well as more information about what we collect.
        </p>
        <h3 class="text-xl my-2 font-bold">2. Legal bases for processing</h3>
        <p class="mb-4">
            We will process your personal information lawfully, fairly and in a transparent manner. We collect and process
            information about you only where we have legal bases for doing so.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-4">
            These legal bases depend on the services you use and how you use them, meaning we collect and use your information only where:
        </p>
        <ul class="list-disc pl-8 mb-4">
            <li>
                it’s necessary for the performance of a contract to which you are a party or to take steps at your request
                before entering into such a contract (for example, when we provide a service you request from us);
            </li>
            <li>
                it satisfies a legitimate interest (which is not overridden by your data protection interests), such as for
                research and development, to market and promote our services, and to protect our legal rights and interests;
            </li>
            <li>you give us consent to do so for a specific purpose (for example, you might consent to us sending you our newsletter); or</li>
            <li>we need to process your data to comply with a legal obligation.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="mb-4">
            Where you consent to our use of information about you for a specific purpose, you have the right to change your
            mind at any time (but this will not affect any processing that has already taken place).
        </p>
        <p class="mb-4">
            We don’t keep personal information for longer than is necessary. While we retain this information, we will protect
            it within commercially acceptable means to prevent loss and theft, as well as unauthorised access, disclosure,
            copying, use or modification. That said, we advise that no method of electronic transmission or storage is 100%
            secure and cannot guarantee absolute data security. If necessary, we may retain your personal information for
            our compliance with a legal obligation or in order to protect your vital interests or the vital interests of
            another natural person.
        </p>
        <h3 class="text-xl my-2 font-bold">3. Collection and use of information</h3>
        <p class="mb-4">
            We may collect, hold, use and disclose information for the following purposes and personal information will not
            be further processed in a manner that is incompatible with these purposes:
        </p>
        <ul class="list-disc pl-8 mb-4">

        </ul>
        <h3 class="text-xl my-2 font-bold">4. Disclosure of personal information to third parties</h3>
        <p class="mb-4">We may disclose personal information to:</p>
        <ul class="list-disc pl-8 mb-4">
            <li>
                third party service providers for the purpose of enabling them to provide their services, including
                (without limitation) IT service providers, data storage, hosting and server providers, ad networks, analytics,
                error loggers, debt collectors, maintenance or problem-solving providers, marketing or advertising providers,
                professional advisors and payment systems operators.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3 class="text-xl my-2 font-bold">5. International transfers of personal information</h3>
        <p class="mb-4">
            The personal information we collect is stored and processed where we or our partners, affiliates and third-party
            providers maintain facilities. By providing us with your personal information, you consent to the disclosure to
            these overseas third parties.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-4">
            We will ensure that any transfer of personal information from countries in the European Economic Area (EEA) to
            countries outside the EEA will be protected by appropriate safeguards, for example by using standard data protection
            clauses approved by the European Commission, or the use of binding corporate rules or other legally accepted means.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-4">
            Where we transfer personal information from a non-EEA country to another country, you acknowledge that third parties
            in other jurisdictions may not be subject to similar data protection laws to the ones in our jurisdiction. There
            are risks if any such third party engages in any act or practice that would contravene the data privacy laws in
            our jurisdiction and this might mean that you will not be able to seek redress under our jurisdiction’s privacy laws.
        </p>
        <h3 class="text-xl my-2 font-bold">6. Your rights and controlling your personal information</h3>
        <p class="mb-4">
