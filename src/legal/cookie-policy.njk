            We use cookies to help improve your experience of <a href="https://omnibug.io/">https://omnibug.io/</a> and
            within our browser extension. This cookie policy is part of <a href="/privacy-policy/">Omnibug's privacy policy</a>,
            and covers the use of cookies between your device and our site. We also provide basic information on
            third-party services we may use, who may also use cookies as part of their service,
            though they are not covered by our policy.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-4">
            If you don’t wish to accept cookies from us, you should instruct your browser to refuse cookies from
            <a href="https://omnibug.io/">https://omnibug.io/</a>, with the understanding that we may be unable to provide
            you with some of your desired content and services.

        <h3 class="text-xl my-2 font-bold">What is a cookie?</h3>
        <p class="mb-4">
            A cookie is a small piece of data that a website stores on your device when you visit, typically containing
            information about the website itself, a unique identifier that allows the site to recognise your web browser
            when you return, additional data that serves the purpose of the cookie, and the lifespan of the cookie itself.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-4">
            Cookies are used to enable certain features (eg. logging in), to track site usage (eg. analytics), to store
            your user settings (eg. timezone, notification preferences), and to personalise your content (eg. advertising, language).
        </p>
        <p class="mb-4">
            Cookies set by the website you are visiting are normally referred to as “first-party cookies”, and typically only
            track your activity on that particular site. Cookies set by other sites and companies (ie. third parties) are called
            “third-party cookies”, and can be used to track you on other websites that use the same third-party service.
        </p>
        <h3 class="text-xl my-2 font-bold">Types of cookies and how we use them</h3>
        <h4 class="text-lg my-2 font-medium">Essential cookies</h4>
        <p class="mb-4">
            Essential cookies are crucial to your experience of a website, enabling core features like user logins,
            account management, shopping carts and payment processing. We do not use this type of cookie on our site.
        </p>
        <h4 class="text-lg my-2 font-medium">Performance cookies</h4>
        <p class="mb-4">
            Performance cookies are used in the tracking of how you use a website during your visit, without collecting
            personal information about you. Typically, this information is anonymous and aggregated with information
            tracked across all site users, to help companies understand visitor usage patterns, identify and diagnose
            problems or errors their users may encounter, and make better strategic decisions in improving their
            audience’s overall website experience. These cookies may be set by the website you’re visiting (first-party) or
            by third-party services. We use performance cookies on our site.
        </p>
        <h4 class="text-lg my-2 font-medium">Functionality cookies</h4>
        <p class="mb-4">
            Functionality cookies are used in collecting information about your device and any settings you may
            configure on the website you’re visiting (like language and timezone settings). With this information,
            websites can provide you with customised, enhanced or optimised content and services. These cookies may
            be set by the website you’re visiting (first-party) or by third-party service. We use functionality
            cookies for selected features on our site.
        </p>
        <h4 class="text-lg my-2 font-medium">Targeting/advertising cookies</h4>
        <p class="mb-4">
            Targeting/advertising cookies are used in determining what promotional content is more relevant and
            appropriate to you and your interests. Websites may use them to deliver targeted advertising or to
            limit the number of times you see an advertisement. This helps companies improve the effectiveness of
            their campaigns and the quality of content presented to you. These cookies may be set by the website
            you’re visiting (first-party) or by third-party services. Targeting/advertising cookies set by third-parties
            may be used to track you on other websites that use the same third-party service. We do not use this
            type of cookie on our site.
        </p>
        <h3 class="text-xl my-2 font-bold">Third-party cookies on our site</h3>
        <p class="mb-4">
            We may employ third-party companies and individuals on our websites—for example, analytics providers and content partners.
            We grant these third parties access to selected information to perform specific tasks on our behalf.
            They may also set third-party cookies in order to deliver the services they are providing. Third-party
            cookies can be used to track you on other websites that use the same third-party service. As we have no
            control over third-party cookies, they are not covered by Omnibug's cookie policy.
        </p>
        <h3 class="text-xl my-2 font-bold">How you can control or opt out of cookies</h3>
        <p class="mb-4">
            If you do not wish to accept cookies from us, you can instruct your browser to refuse cookies from our website.
            Most browsers are configured to accept cookies by default, but you can update these settings to either refuse
            cookies altogether, or to notify you when a website is trying to set or update a cookie.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-4">If you browse websites from multiple devices, you may need to update your settings on each individual device.</p>
        <p class="mb-4">
            Although some cookies can be blocked with little impact on your experience of a website, blocking all cookies
            may mean you are unable to access certain features and content across the sites you visit.
